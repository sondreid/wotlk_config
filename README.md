# Getting started


This repo contains config files, guides and HOWTO's for Azerothcore.

## Client

A client is needed (3.3.5a).

Download client from Chromiecraft [here](https://www.chromiecraft.com/en/downloads/), but any 3.3.5a client will do.
Mods can be found on forums, etc. 


To manage bots, the unbot addon is needed [link](https://github.com/noisiver/unbot-addon/tree/english). Download it, and copy files into interface/addons.



## Connecting to the server
We are not in retail (Kansas) anymore. To use a different server, edit or create Data/enUS/realmlist.wtf, to point to new host.
`set realmlist *hostname* `

gotcha: realmlist.wtf should not be a txt file, .wtf should be the file extension


# Configurations

This repo contains configration files, submodules, etc. Have a look at server_config to see the current sever config.
